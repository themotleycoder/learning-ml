I want to keep track of all the fantastic recommendations and resources available that I can use to dive into the fascinating world of Machine Learning. I have tried to order them based on numerous recommendations I have seen on blogs and videos.

I plan to get started by skipping the math step as I really want to get to the coding etc, but will probably return to the math once I have some more time
